function NewRunData = impose_judgement_using_LSS_model(...
    Model,RunData,Judgements,algorithmIsMinimumDamage)
% This macro update a LSS model projection for forecast judgements.
% It allows users to impose judgement on a projection using a linear state 
% space (LSS) model via: a) the shocks and/or b) by fixing endogenous 
% variables (in which case each fix can be treated as either anticipated 
% or unanticipated) and/or c) by changing any time-varying trends in the 
% model.

%
% DETAILS:  
%   -> This linear state space model forecast macro manages the imposition 
%      of five diffierent types of forecast judgement: (i) judgements to 
%      raw observable; (ii) judgements to model observables; (iii) 
%      judgements to model variables; (iv) judgements to the underlying 
%      shocks; (v) judgements to deterministic time-varying trends.
%   -> Judgements to the shocks (iv) or any time-varying trends (v)
%      are applied directly to the matrices of existing, pre-judgemental 
%      shocks and trends. 
%   -> Judgements made to any of the endogenous variables (i)-(iii) can be 
%      applied either as anticipated (if the model is forward looking) or
%      unanticipated. All of these judgements are combined in model
%      variables space and then the model is inverted to find a new set of
%      of forecast shocks which suuport the projection.
%   -> This new set of forecast shocks (which incorporates any judgements 
%      made in shock space) is combined with the input constraints
%      (forecast initial conditions) to update the projection (with any
%      time-varying trend judgements made affecting the projection for raw
%      observable variables).
%   -> This macro throws an exception if the inputs are not as expected, if 
%      they are not consistent with each other or if any of the LSS model 
%      impose judgement rules are broken. 
%
% NOTES:
%   -> See the MAPS technical documentation for more details on this macro
%      and the modules called herewith.
%   -> The algebra and rules for impose judgement are documented in
%      ANALYTCAL xxxxxxx.
