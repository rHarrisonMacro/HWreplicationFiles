function V = compute_infinite_sum_using_doubling_algorithm(a1,b,a2)
% Uses a simple doubling algorithm to find a fixed point for infinite sum.
%
% INPUTS:   
%   -> a1: first power term
%   -> b: constant
%   -> a2: second power term
%
% OUTPUTS:  
%   -> V: approximation to inifinite sum
%
% DETAILS:  
%   -> Problem is: V = sum_{j=0}^{\infty} [a1^j]*b*[a2^j]
%   -> This can be written recursively as: V = b+a1*V*a2
%
% NOTES:
%   -> This is based on code by Lars Hansen and Thomas Sargent.
%   -> It would be straightforward to extend it to allow for user-defined
%      inputs for the tolerance and maximum iteration number.
