function cyclingDetected = check_OBC_guesses_for_cycling(OBChistory)
% This function checks to see if latest "guess" for occasionally binding
% constraint regimes matches any previously tried guesses. Since the
% previously tried guesses do not constitute an equilibrium, finding a
% match indicates that the solution algorithm is cycling through a
% determinstic sequence of guesses that do not constitute equilibria.
%
% INPUTS
%   -> OBChistory: N*iter numeric matrix indicating OBC regime
%      indicators (note that these are (row) vectorised for cases with
%      multiple OBCs).
