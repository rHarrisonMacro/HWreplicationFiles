% DETAILS:
%   -> This function is designed to support three main use cases: a) an 
%      ODPP with anticipated shocks as judgements; b) impulse responses and
%      other projections which could be a mix of anticipated and 
%      unanticpated shocks; c) stochastic simulation, which would be a 
%      sequence of unanticipated shocks. The function is designed to do the
%      minimum required, which depends on which of the two sets off shocks
%      is present.
%   -> The initialisationFuncHandle must accept the initial condition for
%      the non-instrumente endogenous variables and a set of non-policy
%      anticipated shocks as the first two inputs.  All other inputs 
%      necessary for construction of the guess must be passed to the
%      function anonymously at the time of the creation of the handle.
%
% NOTES:   
%   -> The steady state regime that is returned to over the transition is 
%      one in which none of the instrument constraints is binding.
%   -> The BPY algorithm is initialised with a guess that none of the
%      instrument constraints is binding.  It would be possible to extend
%      this function to permit alternative initialisations (e.g. based on
%      some pre-programmed alternatives implemented in sub-functions or a 
%      general function handle implementation).
%   -> Note that error handling is kept to a minimum.

%% CONSTRUCT RECURSIVE SHOCKS
% By the nature of the problem, it is necessary to recompute expectations
% (i.e. for when the constraints will bind in future) whenever agents' 
% information sets change (i.e. whenever there is an unanticipated shock).
% To simplify below we construct a recursive set of anticipated shocks, 
% zfe, where zfe(:,:,h) is the set of shocks applying in expectation in 
% period h. zfe(:,s,h) references expected shocks in period s, where 
% zfe(:,s,h)=NaN for all s<h and zfe(:,s,h)=0 for all s>H. The number of 
% periods over which it is necessary to compute expectations depends on 
% whether or not the problem contains anticipated shocks and on the user 
% choice in the input Htail. If the projection does contain anticipated 
% shocks then, in each period, it is necessary to compute expectations all 
% the way out to H+Htail. If it does not, then we only need to compute 
% expectations out to 1+Htail.

% new information (unanticipated shocks) arrive.  Note also that, if the
% projection contains anticipated shocks, then the horizon over which 
% expected shadow shocks is computed is reduced as we move through the 
% projection horizon.
